# How to work with me 
Here are some guidelines for working with me for friends and colleagues.

## Stuff to know
- You may call me HT
- If something is not documented, it does not exist.
- I usually work between *0930-1800 CET* 
- I generally do not answer emails after hours or on weekends with a few occasional exceptions.
- I take friday as a meeting-free day to focus on finishing work and unwinding for the weekend
- Ask me anything. Literally anything. Seriously!

## How to communicate with me
- I am a huge advocate of [[Asynchronous communication|asynchronous communication]]
- [Don't just say hello!](https://nohello.net/)
- Artifacts with URLs are good. Aim to create shared artifacts rather than ephemeral undiscoverable messaging trails.
  - If you are messaging me with a reference make sure to include a link or an attachment.

## Meetings
- If a meeting or video conference is expected to exceed 15 minutes, please schedule it a minimum of one day in advance to ensure availability and adequate preparation.
- Punctuality and adherence to contractual obligations are highly important to me. Kindly inform me in advance if you anticipate being late to a meeting or need to cancel.
- When extending a meeting invitation, please include sufficient context as well as clearly defined objectives for the session.
- The primary purpose of meetings is collaborative decision-making. Therefore, it is advisable to come prepared with a clear agenda and a list of discussion points. If I am the initiator of the meeting, I will similarly prepare an agenda and set of questions.
- Transparency and visibility are valued aspects of my work approach. Feel free to inquire about a [[Source]] I am currently focused on, and I will gladly share them with you.
- To maintain open lines of communication, I favor regular one-on-one meetings, preferably on a bi-weekly basis, to provide reciprocal feedback on work performance.
- If the meeting is to be conducted via video conference, please include the necessary link in the invitation for ease of access.

## Documentation
I advocate for three principles in documentation, which I refer to as **ALE** üç∫üçª. You can also find these principles at [alemanifesto.com](https://alemanifesto.com/).

#### Accessible

- A document must be searchable.
- A document should be accessible to everyone with just a click.
- A document should be comprehensible to readers from various disciplines.
- Navigation through the document should be straightforward.

#### Living

- Outdated documentation is worse than having no documentation.
- Make updating the document a **natural** part of your process.
- Regularly review and revise the content for accuracy and relevance.
- Establish a timeline for document audits to keep information current.
- Use version control to track changes and updates effectively.

#### Easy to Contribute

Maintaining well-crafted documentation is challenging. Achieving quality, accessibility, and up-to-date information is easier through good collaboration.
- Opt for a widely-used format; Markdown is recommended for its flexibility and portability.
- Enable contributions from not just maintainers, but also readers, to enrich the documentation.
