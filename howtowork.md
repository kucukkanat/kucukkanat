# How to work with me 

Here are some guidelines for working with me for friends and colleagues.

## Stuff to know

- I use "Tolga" as my first name
- I usually work between *0930-1800 CET* 
- [Don't just say hello!](https://nohello.net/)
- Artifacts with URLSs are good. Aim to create shared artifacts rather than ephemeral undiscoverable messaging trails.
  - If you are messaging me with a reference make sure to include a link or an attachment.
- I generally do not answer emails after hours or on weekends with a few occasional exceptions.
- I take friday as a meeting-free day to focus on finishing work.
- If something is not documented, it does not exist.
- Ask me anything. Literally anything. Seriously!

## Meetings

- If you require a meeting (or a video call) longer than 15 minutes then schedule it at least a day in advance.
- Contracts and time discipline matters much to me. Please notify if you are going to be late for a meeting or need to cancel.
- If you are sending a meeting invitation please include some context and meeting goals
- Meetings are more to make decisions collaboratively. Have a clear goal and a list of questions beforehand. I will be attending with mine if I am the one inviting you for a meeting.
- I like to be visible and transparent at work. Ask me about a _source_ that I am working on and I will point you to it.
- I like to keep in touch 1-1, preferably bi-weekly we will be scheduling meetings to exchange feedback on each others work.
- Include a link if you are sending a video call invitation

## Documentation

I believe in 3 principles for documentation that I call ALE Ôç∫

- Accessible
- Living
- Easy to contribute

#### Accessible 
- A document has to be accessible by everybody with the ease of a click. 
- Comprehensible for readers from different disciplines.
- Easy to navigate

#### Living
- An outdated documentation is less than useless. Automate the documentation if you can.
- If documentation can not be automated implement documentation maintenance to your natural processes.

#### Easy to Contribute
It is hard to have a well maintained documentation at all times. The accesibility and the living principles together 
with quality only comes with good collaboration. 
- Pick a popular format. Markdown is encouraged for it's flexibility and mobility.
- Make it possible for not only the maintainers but also readers to contribute to the documentation.
